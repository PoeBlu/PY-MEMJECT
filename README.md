**About:**
```
Windows API functions process goes as follows:

     OpenProcess() --> Injector attaches to host process
           |---> VirtualAllocEx() --> Memory allocates for host process
                 |---> WriteProcessMemory() --> Copy DLL to host process
                      |---> CreateRemoteThread() --> Code execution

```

*Preface:* There are a couple of types of DLL injection, this utilizes the "Runtime" injection method, which is a legitimate Win32API usage, using only Win32API functions we can inject a malicious DLL path into other running processes. DLL injection is a very common behavior of malware, with over 40% of malware having the capability to inject itself or other malicious code into running processes, usually to establish persistence on a system. DLL injection is also commonly found in video game cheating, where a user can inject a cheat menu into the game.

*Breaking down the Windows API functions:* There are four main steps to injecting a DLL payload into running processes. The steps are simply to first attach and set up a handler to a running process which will allow us to communicate with it. Then you will allocate space in memory in the host (victim) process that you are injecting. Then, you will inject and copy the malicious DLLs path into that host processes allocated space. And finally calling a function with the address of the LoadLibrary function which causes the injected DLL file's path to be loaded into memory and executed via the infected process.

   1. [**OpenProcess()**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess) OpenProcess() is responsible for setting up access to a process object and returning a handle to us as a means of communication with the process we select.
   2. [ **VirtualAllocEx()**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualallocex). VirtualAllocEx() is responsible for allocating memory space in the victim process for the malicious DLLs path to be injected. 
   3. [**WriteProcessMemory()**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-writeprocessmemory). WriteProcessMemory() is responsible for writing the malicious DLL path to the area of memory that has been allocated with the previous step. 
   4. [**LoadLibraryA**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya) LoadLibrary() is a kernel32.dll function which is used to load libraries and DLLs at runtime, We can have LoadLibraryA locate the address of kernel32.dll since kernel32.dll is mapped to the same address in almost every process. LoadLibraryA also happens to fit the thread start routine needed by CreateRemoteThread(). From a malware author's perspective, LoadLibrary registers DLLs with the process, making LoadLibrary easily detected, so an alternative is to load the DLL from memory with something like a reflective DLL attack.
   5. [**CreateRemoteThread()**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createremotethread). Calling CreateRemoteThread() and passing it the address of LoadLibrary causes the injected path of the malicious DLL to be loaded into memory and executed. Alternatives to CreateRemoteThread are calling NtCreateThreadEx or RtlCreateUserThread. From a malware author's point of view, CreateRemoteThread is highly tracked and flagged by common AV products. This function method also requires a malicious DLL on disk, which is much easier to detect than some alternate DLL injection methods where the DLL is loaded from memory.
